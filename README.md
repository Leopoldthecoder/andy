### How to use
- Pick an image
- A pop art styled avatar is generated
- Download the avatar
- Or fine-tune the avatar by configuring some parameters before actually downloading it

### Security
Your image (both original and generated) will not be uploaded anywhere. Everything runs in the client.

### Credits
The idea was originally from [@hexwing](https://github.com/hexwing), and [@waynecz](https://github.com/waynecz) helped me sort things out.
